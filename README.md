## 🕹️ Gameplay

Sort all the colored blocks into their respective containers! Each color must be grouped in a single column. Move colors by clicking to select and then clicking another container to pour — just like real-life liquid puzzles.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The game generates `N` boxes (`boxAmount`), each filled with a mix of colors.
- Your goal: Group identical colors into the same box.
- One box can only hold up to 4 colored blocks.
- You can only pour if:
  - The destination box has space.
  - The color you're pouring matches the top color of the destination.
